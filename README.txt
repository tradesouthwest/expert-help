== Description ==

Plugin will help you with your theme and plugin work done by Codeable Expert.
This is also a good starter plugin for creatingg namespace based plugins.
It is suggested that you add `yourname-` in front of the prefix to avoid prefix crashing.
ex.: replace "expert-help" & "expert_plugin" with "yourname-expert-help" & "yourname_expert_help"
